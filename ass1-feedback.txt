MMRow.create creates a new random instance for each iteration of the loop. A single instance should have been created before the loop.
MMGuesser.guess performs a somewhat expensive operation each time it is called (generating all possible cases) even though this data isn't changed. It should be generated once, stored, then reused.
I can't quite determine what is wrong with your MMGuesser.guess method as the logic isn't particularly simple to follow. I would hazard a guess that it is something to do with your "minimax" section but as I am unsure what the purpose of eliminationCounter is I cannot really say. Sorry!
